# IcamOneSat2U
Projet Majeur Semetre I4.8 -Icam/CNES

## Objective
<p>This project's porpose is the developpement, dimensioning and assembling of a CubeSat <br>(A miniaturized Satellite with a cubic form factor).<p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/cubesat.png"><p>

<p>Contrarily to traditional CubeSats, this particular one won't be launched to space. It's a simpler version designed to be attached to a ballon and travel <em> some distance</em> while capting and transmitting information such as temperature, pression, coordinates, etc...<p>

<p>The following sections are meant to go deeper into the project's developement and organisation.<p>
